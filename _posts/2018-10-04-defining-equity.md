Earlier this year, I was tasked with defining equity. What does this word, which is tossed around so frequently in educational discourse, really mean? Here are some of my thoughts on the subject, excerpted from a much longer piece.

## What is it not?

While defining equity, it is important to acknowledge what it is not. Equity is not equality of opportunity. The American dream is built upon the notion of equal opportunity, and therefore equality is often held as an essential characteristic of a just society. However, the structures of society, including systemic racism and hegemonic meritocracy, prevent many people from prospering under equality of opportunity. Equity is also not equality of outcome. In the context of teaching and learning, equality of outcome means that every student, no matter what skills and knowledges they enter the classroom with, exits with access to dominant discourses and the power to affect change in their world. As equity is the center of my teaching practice, I cannot define it with such idealism—it must be a practical notion which can guide my teaching.

## What is it?
For this reason, I define equity as a complex process which involves the constant re-evaluation of one’s actions, practices, and mindset. The purpose of this re-evaluation is to ensure that one’s actions, practices, and mindset are aligned with the ultimate goal of education, equality of outcome. As part of this re-evaluation process, educators must consider the individual identities of their students. Do my practices allow all students, no matter their cultural or socioeconomic background, fair access to classroom resources? Do these resources meet their individual needs as measured by academic success and social emotional health? Additionally, a teacher must consider whether their practices enhance or inhibit student agency. An equitable teaching practice pushes students to view power critically, and empowers them as agents of change. Accounting for identity, access, and achievement ([see Gutiérrez](https://www.todos-math.org/assets/documents/TEEMv1n1excerpt.pdf)) is all but worthless if students do not have a critical mindset which allows them to critique the structures of society.
