Multiplying.
Multiplying — quickly, quickly. 
My eyes, my nose, my toesis. Mitosis — spreading, spreading, quickly. 

In a parking lot I sit, back row of a 
    Black Mercedes SUV with
    Black — chocolate — frosted Entenmann’s donuts. 
One dozen donuts, several dozen tears, every love hears:
    Brother, Sister, Mother —
    Father.

Even now they are:
Multiplying.
Multiplying — quickly, quickly. 
My eyes, my nose, my toesis. Mitosis — spreading, spreading, quickly. 

The surgery, it’s 
burned in me.
scarred on him.

Cancer

When I was in fourth grade, my father had his first surgery of many. I didn’t know exactly what was going on, but my best friend’s mother, Mrs. Schwartz, told me I was going home with her that day. What great news! We played Monkeyball on the Gamecube, and in the evening we played our favorite game — RuneScape. It must have been near the end of October, because I remember being very upset when my mother came to pick me up: I was in the middle of getting the *exclusive* Halloween event gear, and I had been told I was having a sleepover with my best friend. Then, along comes my mother to ruin my fun. How annoying! My mom told me she just wanted to have the whole family together because my father was in the hospital. I pouted as we drove home.
